`rbiom` is designed for microbiome researchers, providing visualizations and 
statistical analyses from Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) files.


## Installation

The latest stable version can be installed from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages('rbiom')
```

The development version is available on GitHub.

``` r
install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('cmmr/rbiom')
```


## Usage

#### Import and rarefy abundance counts.
```{r usage}
library(rbiom)

infile <- system.file(package = 'rbiom', 'extdata', 'hmp50.bz2')
biom   <- rarefy(infile)
```


#### Explore associations with metadata.
```{r bdiv}
bdiv_ord_plot(biom, stat.by = 'Body Site', facet.by = 'Sex')
adiv_boxplot(biom, x = 'Sex', adiv = c('otu', 'shan'), stat.by = 'Body Site')
subset(biom, `Body Site` == 'Buccal mucosa') %>% 
  taxa_corrplot('Age', taxa = 2, layers = 'ptc', fit = 'lm', test = 'emtrends')
```


#### Summarize counts by taxonomic rank.
```{r taxa}
taxa_heatmap(biom, taxa = 10, tracks = c('body', 'age'))
taxa_stacked(biom, rank = 'Phylum')
taxa_table(biom, 'Phylum')
```
