taxa_corrplot(
  biom,
  x,
  rank = -1,
  layers = "tc",
  taxa = 6,
  lineage = FALSE,
  unc = "singly",
  other = FALSE,
  stat.by = NULL,
  facet.by = NULL,

  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- biom:

  An [rbiom
  object](https://cmmr.github.io/rbiom/reference/rbiom_objects.md), or
  any value accepted by
  [`as_rbiom()`](https://cmmr.github.io/rbiom/reference/as_rbiom.md).

- x:

  Dataset field with the x-axis values. Equivalent to the `regr`
  argument in
  [`stats_table()`](https://cmmr.github.io/rbiom/reference/stats_table.md).
  Required.

- rank:

  What rank(s) of taxa to display. E.g. `"Phylum"`, `"Genus"`, `".otu"`,
  etc. An integer vector can also be given, where `1` is the highest
  rank, `2` is the second highest, `-1` is the lowest rank, `-2` is the
  second lowest, and `0` is the OTU "rank". Run `biom$ranks` to see all
  options for a given rbiom object. Default: `-1`.

- layers:

  One or more of
  `c("trend", "confidence", "point", "name", "residual")`. Single letter
  abbreviations are also accepted. For instance, `c("trend", "point")`
  is equivalent to `c("t", "p")` and `"tp"`. Default: `"tc"`

- taxa:

  Which taxa to display. An integer value will show the top n most
  abundant taxa. A value 0 \<= n \< 1 will show any taxa with that mean
  abundance or greater (e.g. `0.1` implies \>= 10%). A character vector
  of taxa names will show only those named taxa. Default: `6`.

- lineage:

  Include all ranks in the name of the taxa. For instance, setting to
  `TRUE` will produce
  `Bacteria; Actinobacteria; Coriobacteriia; Coriobacteriales`.
  Otherwise the taxa name will simply be `Coriobacteriales`. You want to
  set this to TRUE when `unc = "asis"` and you have taxa names (such as
  *Incertae_Sedis*) that map to multiple higher level ranks. Default:
  `FALSE`

- unc:

  How to handle unclassified, uncultured, and similarly ambiguous taxa
  names. Options are:

  `"singly"` -

  :   Replaces them with the OTU name.

  `"grouped"` -

  :   Replaces them with a higher rank's name.

  `"drop"` -

  :   Excludes them from the result.

  `"asis"` -

  :   To not check/modify any taxa names.

  Abbreviations are allowed. Default: `"singly"`

- other:

  Sum all non-itemized taxa into an "Other" taxa. When `FALSE`, only
  returns taxa matched by the `taxa` argument. Specifying `TRUE` adds
  "Other" to the returned set. A string can also be given to imply
  `TRUE`, but with that value as the name to use instead of "Other".
  Default: `FALSE`

- stat.by:

  Dataset field with the statistical groups. Must be categorical.
  Default: `NULL`

- facet.by:

  Dataset field(s) to use for faceting. Must be categorical. Default:
  `NULL`

- colors:

  How to color the groups. Options are:

  `TRUE` -

  :   Automatically select colorblind-friendly colors.

  `FALSE` or `NULL` -

  :   Don't use colors.

  a palette name -

  :   Auto-select colors from this set. E.g. `"okabe"`

  character vector -

  :   Custom colors to use. E.g. `c("red", "#00FF00")`

  named character vector -

  :   Explicit mapping. E.g. `c(Male = "blue", Female = "red")`

  See "Aesthetics" section below for additional information. Default:
  `TRUE`

- shapes:

  Shapes for each group. Options are similar to `colors`'s: `TRUE`,
  `FALSE`, `NULL`, shape names (typically integers 0 - 17), or a named
  vector mapping groups to specific shape names. See "Aesthetics"
  section below for additional information. Default: `TRUE`

- test:

  Method for computing p-values: `'none'`, `'emmeans'`, or `'emtrends'`.
  Default: `'emmeans'`

- fit:

  How to fit the trendline. `'lm'`, `'log'`, or `'gam'`. Default:
  `'gam'`

- at:

  Position(s) along the x-axis where the means or slopes should be
  evaluated. Default: `NULL`, which samples 100 evenly spaced positions
  and selects the position where the p-value is most significant.

- level:

  The confidence level for calculating a confidence interval. Default:
  `0.95`

- p.adj:

  Method to use for multiple comparisons adjustment of p-values. Run
  `p.adjust.methods` for a list of available options. Default: `"fdr"`

- transform:

  Transformation to apply to calculated values. Options are:
  `c("none", "rank", "log", "log1p", "sqrt", "percent")`. `"rank"` is
  useful for correcting for non-normally distributions before applying
  regression statistics. Default: `"none"`

- ties:

  When `transform="rank"`, how to rank identical values. Options are:
  `c("average", "first", "last", "random", "max", "min")`. See
  [`rank()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/rank.html) for details. Default:
  `"random"`

- seed:

  Random seed for permutations. Must be a non-negative integer. Default:
  `0`

- alt:

  Alternative hypothesis direction. Options are `'!='` (two-sided; not
  equal to `mu`), `'<'` (less than `mu`), or `'>'` (greater than `mu`).
  Default: `'!='`

- mu:

  Reference value to test against. Default: `0`

- caption:

  Add methodology caption beneath the plot. Default: `TRUE`

- check:

  Generate additional plots to aid in assessing data normality. Default:
  `FALSE`

- ...:

  Additional parameters to pass along to ggplot2 functions. Prefix a
  parameter name with a layer name to pass it to only that layer. For
  instance, `p.size = 2` ensures only the points have their size set to
  `2`.

## Value

A `ggplot2` plot. The computed data points, ggplot2 command, stats
table, and stats table commands are available as `$data`, `$code`,
`$stats`, and `$stats$code`, respectively.

## Aesthetics

All built-in color palettes are colorblind-friendly. The available
categorical palette names are: `"okabe"`, `"carto"`, `"r4"`,
`"polychrome"`, `"tol"`, `"bright"`, `"light"`, `"muted"`, `"vibrant"`,
`"tableau"`, `"classic"`, `"alphabet"`, `"tableau20"`, `"kelly"`, and
`"fishy"`.

Shapes can be given as per base R - numbers 0 through 17 for various
shapes, or the decimal value of an ascii character, e.g. a-z = 65:90;
A-Z = 97:122 to use letters instead of shapes on the plot. Character
strings may used as well.
