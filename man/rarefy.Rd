\title{Subset counts so that all samples have the same number of observations.}
\usage{
rarefy(biom, depth = NULL, seed = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{biom}{A \code{matrix}, \code{simple_triplet_matrix}, or \code{BIOM} 
object, as returned from \link{read.biom}. For matrices, the rows and 
columns are assumed to be the taxa and samples, respectively.}

\item{depth}{The number of observations to keep, per sample. If set to
\code{NULL}, a depth will be automatically selected. Samples that have
fewer than this number of observations will be dropped. If called on
data with non-integer abundances, values will be re-scaled to integers 
between 1 and \code{depth} such that they sum to \code{depth}.}

\item{seed}{An integer to use for seeding the random number generator. If
you need to create different random rarefactions of the same \code{BIOM}
object, set this seed value to a different number each time.}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix}, \code{simple_triplet_matrix}, or \code{BIOM} 
    object, depending on the input object type. The type of object provided
    is the same type that is returned. The retained observations are randomly
    selected, based on a seed value derived from the \code{BIOM} object. 
    Therefore, rarefying the same biom to the same depth will always produce
    the same resultant rarification.
